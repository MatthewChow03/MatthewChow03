### Hey!

I'm Matthew, a third-year Computer Engineering student and Computer Science teaching assistant at the **University of British Columbia**.

I currently write embedded software at **Tesla** for the Chassis Controls and Drive Inverter systems of the newest vehicles. Previously, I wrote firmware tools and continuous integration tests at **Generac** for their leading clean energy products.

Here are some cool things I've worked on in the past:
- [⚙️ Hardware Emulation Models](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mdchow_firmware-embeddedsystems-software-activity-7094813845424144384-14UN) - custom peripheral support using the open-source [Renode framework](https://github.com/renode/renode)
- [🏎️ Safety Critical Motor Control Firmware](https://github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3/tree/master/components/mcb/mcb_main) - a drive control system for a solar-powered race car
- [📺 Dot Matrix LCD Interface](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/Dashboard-Firmware) - an instruction set interface to support an esoteric piece of hardware
- [🌐 Race Car Telemetry System](https://github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3/tree/master/components/tel) - a real-time operating system interfacing with sensors, buses, and radio modules
- [⚡ Motion Spike Detection](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/drone-motion-detector) - Python scripts to capture and analyze IMU data from a Raspberry Pi 
- [💡 LED Strip Controller](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/LED-Strip-Controller) - a command line application to support an off-the-shelf colored light strip
- [🦾 Autonomous Claw Algorithms](https://github.com/MatthewChow03/Autonomous-Claw) - a cardboard claw with smart timing and sensing features
