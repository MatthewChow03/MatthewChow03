<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>


I am an engineering student pursuing a major in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.

<h3 align="left">ðŸš€ The Dream</h3>

I was born and raised in East Vancouver, comforted by familiarity and a sense of community. I want to break out of that comfort, bringing the values I have gained to a new chapter. With my career, I am looking to work abroad and use my skills in larger marketsâ€”for larger goals. 

My passion is computer engineering with a niche in sustainability and transportation. I believe cars today are not mechanical, electrical, or manufacturing endeavours, they are software driven robots. It fascinates me that vehicles have brains, implemented in the roots of their embedded systems.

I aim to build up the skills needed to engineer the next generation of automobiles; between my degree, my projects, my tenacity, and my ambition, I hope to be on the right path. Working on solar race cars, I am gaining experience as a developer, but also a perspective on sustainability that is vital to people, profit, and the planet. 

My dream is to work on the next generation of intelligent transportation while minimizing the impacts that vehicles have on our world.

<h3 align="left">ðŸŽ¸ Fun Facts </h3>

I am a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNUxJOEgT5F/" target="_blank">self taught guitarist</a> and a one man band. I play the melody, chords, bassline, and occasionally, the percussion. This is also known as (percussive) fingerstyle.

I have been weightlifting for over 4 years, battling many health complications along the way. I am currently dealing with a growth in my ankle, but I like to say that every challenge someone faces is a lesson that can be taught to others. I am always open to having a chat about diet, training programs, and answering any questions you have about fitness. Shoot me an email!


<h3 align="left">ðŸŒŽ My Mantras</h3>

- Missing an opportunity can hurt more than failure itself.
- Working with people who make you smile is a core virtue of any job.
- If you are truly passionate about something, you will find time for it.

<b><h2 align="center">What I'm Up To</h2></b>

<h3 align="left">âš¡ Race Car Firmware </h3>

My work with the UBC Solar design team centers around PCB firmware development using **STM32** microcontrollers, **CAN** networks, and embedded systems design in **C**. I implemented an **RTOS** task for the main control board of the car to protect the motor from overheating. I am testing and debugging the main control board with a logic analyzer and STM32 IDE.

> *Next: create the firmware for the vehicle's internal display using interrupts to integrate the display with the CANbus.* 

<h3 align="left">ðŸ“¡ LED Strip Transceiver</h3>

Most coloured LED strips are controlled via a remote or bluetooth app; I created a small circuit to control the LEDs from my computer. I developed **C++** firmware that worked with the transceiver circuit and an **Arduino** board. This code can be run directly from the terminal using a **PowerShell** script that I wrote to interface with the serial port.

> *Next: add a GUI to improve the UX compared to interacting with the terminal.* 
>
> *After: use pin change interrupts to controll TX and RX.*

<h3 align="left">ðŸ“š Student Database Visualizer</h3>

I am building a database using **MySQL** and **Python** to store student grades and courses. The goal is to learn databases, responsive web development, and interactive UIs while creating a project that will help students organize their grades and perform calculations on the data.

> *Next: implement a **Flask** webserver to visualize the database.* 
> 
> *After: add a grade sorting visualizer to the web server using **React**.*

<h3 align="left">ðŸ’ª EMG Controlled Drone</h3> 

The movement of any muscle releases electrical signals that can be read with an EMG sensor. I am working on a circuit that connects an EMG sensor to a drone controller, powering a drone's liftoff with muscle movements. I am writing a **C++** program to power an **Arduino** microcontroller. The Arduino will parse the EMG data and send it to the controller.

> *Next: use EEG brain waves to control the drone instead of EMG signals.*
